# BeeOnline

BeeOnline is a **community-built, arcade-inspired multiplayer game** designed from the ground up with **online networking** and **cross-platform play** in mind.

The project is **inspired by the gameplay feel** of the arcade game *Killer Queen*, but is **not a remake, clone, or unofficial port**. BeeOnline is an independent project with original code, assets, and design decisions, focused on bringing similar high-energy, team-based gameplay into a modern online environment.
